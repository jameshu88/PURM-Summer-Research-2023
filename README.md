# Penn PURM Linguistics Research Projects

Welcome to the repository for three in-game websites that I developed as part of linguistics research under the Penn Undergraduate Research Mentorship (PURM) scholarship at the Penn Phonetics Lab in the University of Pennsylvania.

## Penn PURM Taiko

Penn PURM Taiko is a JavaScript-based rhythm game inspired by Taiko no Tatsujin. It measures users' rhythmic perception to correlate with their levels of linguistic and music education. The app utilizes JavaScript and stores data in a MySQL database.


## Penn PURM Timbre
Penn PURM Timbre is another JavaScript game that measures players' abilities to differentiate between instrument timbres. It provides a fun and engaging way to compare players' ability to differentiate vocal timbres.

## Penn PURM VocalSense
Penn PURM VocalSense is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app. This game measures players' abilities to differentiate between the intonations of two speakers by asking which elephant has spoken in a higher tone.
